<%# This is a comment in EJS, see https://ejs.co/

We're using EJS for two reasons:
1. We need to supply a different set of Javascript scripts for dev and production
2. We need a way to strip comments out of the manifest.json

There are many ways to achieve (2), but since we needed (1), why not get both from the
same tool...

This is not an auto-generated file, but please leave that HTML comment there...

Note the use of the closing tag with the leading "-", indicating "trim-mode ('newline slurp')"
