The tile of a tab encodes the state of a tab:
- If a tab is in state "unloaded", the tile title will be italicized and "muted", and the icon will be
  grayed. This means the tab exists, but its contents have not been loaded
- If a tab is in state "complete" (finished loading), no visual indication will appear
  * If it's loading, a badge shows up in the bottom right of the tile
- Other properties show up in badges

Why offer "close and go back"?
- Chrome natively goes back to the previous tab if you open another tab then close it
- However, that behavior applies within a single window. If you are on a tab X on window A and open
  a tab Y in another window B, then when you close tab Y (provided other tabs still exist in window B),
  Chrome will go back to another tab in window B, not go back to tab X on window A
- Also, if you're on tab X on window A (tab X is not the right-most tab on window A) and double click
  a shortcut/link from Windows Explorer, a new tab Y opens on window A, but when you close tab Y you're
  taken back to the tab positionally before tab Y, not back to tab A [TO BE CONTINUED TBD TBD]
 
What's the difference between this and chrome://inspect/#pages
- Chrome inspect pages is a DevTool, and shows info for developers, so for each page you'll also
  see iFrames or other embedded things


TAB SEARCH
- Enter search mode by typing a character, the searchbox appears and the search starts
- Search is case insensitive
- When typing a search term, the popup tries to match the search term on the tab's title,
  URL, and badges (so you can type "highlighted" to find all the tabs that are highlighted)
- Search results auto-update as tabs change, so a tab that's in the search results will
  go away if its state changes in such a way that it doesn't match the search anymore
  (e.g. if you load a new URL in a tab)

SHORTCUTS
- This extensions includes a number of useful shortcuts, described below
- You can configure the shortcuts by visiting the extension's shortcuts box inside
  chrome://extensions/shortcuts
- Many of the shortcuts defined by this extension are designed to be "Global",
  but you can decide whether you want to set them as "Chrome" (available only when
  a Chrome window is in focus) or "Global" (available from anywhere in the system)
- We suggested a few keyboard combinations, but you should decide which combinations
  make more sense for you.

SHORTCUT "Activate the extension"
- It can be useful to add a shortcut to open the extension popup without the need
  to click on the extension icon
- Suggested keyboard shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+ArrowUp

SHORTCUT "Clipboard launch/search"
- A keyboard shortcut is available to quickly open a new tab, and load the contents
  of the clipboard in it
- If the clipboard contains a URL, that URL will be loaded
- If the clipboard contains text that doesn't match the specification of a URL, the
  text will be used to launch a Google search (default search engine)
  * Note that "www.google.com" is not a valid URL per the standard specification,
    while "https://www.google.com" is
- The search engine to use for the search case is configurable
- Suggested keyboard shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+ArrowDown

SHORTCUTS "Tabs history"
- As you move through tabs, you can use these shortcuts to go back and forth among tabs
  you have recently activated, regardless of the window they're in (supports navigation
  across windows)
- Firefox offers this feature natively (only within a window), while Chrome doesn't
- Suggested keyboard shortcuts: CTRL+SHIFT+ArrowLeft ("back"), CTRL+SHIFT+ArrowRight ("forward")
- The "back" shortcut is particularly useful when set to "Global" instead of Chrome, because
  it allows you to go back to the last tab you were reading before you jumped off to other
  applications
  * Unlike the system shortcuts to move back (like Alt+Tab in Windows), this shortcut allows
    to jump back immediately to the last browser tab, regardless of how many other apps you've
	visited in between
- Optionally there are also two extra shortcuts to close the current tab before navigating
  to the previous or next tab

CUSTOM SHORTCUTS
- You can define up to 5 custom shortcuts
- Suggested keyboard shortcuts: CTRL+SHIFT+1, ..., CTRL+SHIFT+5
- These shortcuts can be particularly useful when set to "Global" instead of Chrome, because
  they allow you to jump to a specific tab from any other application, regardless of whether
  the tab is active or not
  * E.g., set a shortcut to bring to the front the tab with your email client  
- You can set a shortcut to target either a hostname or a URL (not both)
- The tab targeted by the shortcut will be the positionally left-most tab among
  all the tabs that match the hostname or the complete URL. If no tabs match
  the hostname or URL, the shortcut will open a new tab
  * If the shortcut targets a URL, you can change this behavior by selecting the
    "always new tab" option, which will cause the shortcut to always open a new tab,
	and never reuse existing tabs
- When using a target URL, you can select the "use clipboard" option to enable
  the shortcut to replace the first occurrence of the string "%s" in the URL
  with the contents of the clipboard (shortcut "search mode")
  * "%s" must be lowercase, "%S" won't match
  * "%s" can't be part of the hostname
  * This behavior is similar to the behavior of the custom search engines in the
    omnibar, except that it uses the clipboard contents as input
- After the "%s" replacement, if "always new tab" is not selected, the shortcut
  will try to match the exact URL of an existing tab, and if a match is found,
  activate that tab. If a match is not found, the positionally left-most tab
  matching the hostname of the search URL ("first candidate" tab) will be opened
- When you configure a custom shortcut, the tab targeted by the shortcut displays a badge
  with a shorthand for the shortcut name (e.g. "SC2" for the second shortcut)
  * In search mode, if multiple tabs match the shortcut, the positionally left-most
    tab will have the badge in black, while all others (candidate tabs) will show
	the badge grayed out
  * You can move tabs in the windows to change the left-most tab, or use the corresponding
    menu item in the tile dropdown menu to change the current allocation
- You can search for tabs targeted by custom shortcuts by typing the shortcut shorthand
  in the searchbox
