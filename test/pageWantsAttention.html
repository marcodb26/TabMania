		This page runs a script that changes the title of the page every second 10 times, then stops.<br>
		The tabsTitleMonitor "wantsAttention" logic should make the tile of the page go to the top of
		the tiles list while the title changes, starting from the 4th change. The 4th change should be
		cnt == 2:
		<ul>
		<li>1st transition: from page URL to original title in HTML</li>
		<li>2nd transition: from original title, to cnt = 0</li>
		<li>3rd transition: from cnt = 0, to cnt = 1</li>
		<li>4th transition: from cnt = 1, to cnt = 2</li>
		</ul>
		See also comment at TabsTitleMonitor._minTransitionsCountForAttention.<br>
		Then the tile should stay at the top for 10 seconds	(the value of tabsTitleMonitor._timeSensitivity)
		after the title stopped changing, then go back to its standard place in the list.
