While working on TabMania 1.1 on 2/28/2021, I started playing with about 700 tiles
in TabMania, and observed noticeable delays. My performance measurements from inside
my Javascript claimed my code was done within less than a second, but a CSS animation
(that was getting interrupted at the same time my "end" performance counter was getting
marked) went on blinking for a good 4-5 seconds longer than it should have).

Chrome DevTools "Performance" tab showed that FontAwesome is tripling the amount of
time spent processing my updates (mostly, appending 700 tiles to a container <div>).
The best part is that I'm not explicitly using Font Awesome... after removing it from
the code running on the page, the performance suddenly increased.

See Font Awesome 5.15.2 performance issue.png (my code circled in blue, Font Awesome
circled in red) and Font Awesome 5.15.2 performance issue.json (the full data from
the profiling session)
